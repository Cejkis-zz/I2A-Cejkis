# I2A-Cejkis (under development)
my attempt to replicate the paper Imagination augmented agents for deep reinforcement learning https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06203.

Main file is rlcode. Map and sokoban are the environment. Pre-generated sokoban maps are in folder "levels"

I'm using this repository as a baseline A3C
